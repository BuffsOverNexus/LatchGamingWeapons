# Latch Gaming - Weapons
There are three types of weapons within the server: Donator (VIP), Free (Vanilla), and Custom (VIP and Staff).

## How to create an issue
Hypothetical situation: The AWP is too good. It's power needs to be reduced slightly.

Steps:
1) Create an "issue"
2) Add the assignee "BuffsOverNexus"
3) Add the label "nerf (-)" *Note this is because we will be reducing the power of the weapon*
4) In the title, type "AWP - Too much damage"
5) In the body of the issue, please explain why you think this change is necessary. You may also suggest the value(s) if you are able to read the weapon files. This is not necessary!
6) Submit the issue and wait for staff to review your post in the next staff meeting!
